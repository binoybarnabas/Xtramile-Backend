INTRODUCTION

Javascript executes function using call stack
Call stack synchronous

Task Queue. inside task queue micro task queue
Promise comes inside task queue

Event loop checks microtaskqueue and callstack
Event loop listens and when a promise comes inside queue, event loop puts the promise in the stack

TS built upon JS. We write TS code but ion the browser JS is the one that is running

Ecmascript sets the standard for JS

Babel -> Backwards Compatibility

jsfiddle online compiler

let and const to declare variables

Before angular every page was loaded everytime an action was performed which consumed time and RAM. Angular renders the page based on only the change (eg: SideNav and Topbar need not chnage when an action is performed)

Primitive datatypes - pass by value
Reference types - objects, arrays

lname a key value pair in an object
lname?: string -> lname(key) may or may not be present 
lname : string | undefined -> value in lname may or may not be present

const obj = {
   key1 : value,
   key2 : value
}

const {key1,key2} = obj   =>   Destructuring

spread operator (...)
To copy an object. Creates a new memory address
Does not work for nested objects
To change this,
-> convert object to string, chage and convert back to object. Also used to compare two objects
JSON.stringify

string method split is used to convert to an array

obj[key] can also be used to access object

Angular is a framework. They provide structure so low flexibility

createing a new component, the component lies inside app folder
package.json => to store package list

ngFor can be used to return index, firstvalue, lastvalue, count, odd and even values. Odd even (true or false	)
